# Computer Science Research Paper Abstract Semantic Search

This project aims to implement a semantic search system for research papers. The goal is to enable users to search for relevant research papers based on the meaning and context of their queries, rather than just keyword matching.

This project is available as a demo here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/hwca96/CS_Paper_Abstract_Semantic_Search

## Features

- Semantic search: The system uses natural language processing techniques to understand the meaning of user queries and retrieve relevant research papers.
